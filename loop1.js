// The For Loop
// The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:
// 
// for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
// }` 
// Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

// Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

// Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
